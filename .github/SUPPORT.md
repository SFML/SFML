## I have trouble setting up SFML?!

The official [SFML Tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/latest/#getting-started) feature detailed setup descriptions for some compilers.

By far the simplest setup, with cross-platform guarantees, is to use the [SFML CMake Template](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project).
Follow the instructions in the README.

Don't forget, SFML is just like any other C++ library:

-   Tell the compiler where to find the SFML headers
-   Tell the linker which libraries to link
-   Make sure to use the same runtime library as was used for SFML

## I don't understand how to use SFML?!

The [official tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/latest/) and [documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/latest/) provide a lot of information to understand the ins and outs of SFML.
