RubySFML - Copyright (c) 2007 Sean O'Neil and Laurent Gomila

RubySFML relies on a lot of third-party open-source software, and since it is
a library itself, I need to make sure everyone who uses it is aware of the
various licenses it comes with, as well as to give credit where credit is due.
If you distribute applications that use RubySFML, you may also be required to
give credit where credit is due.
